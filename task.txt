Task for SDE (Full Stack)

Company A has an existing social media application and they want to introduce a new feature called “Events for you” that presents users with customized events/shows/concerts etc. 

Events are produced and consumed by end users only. 
An event can stretch for multiple days and each day it will have the same duration, 
it should have contact details of organizers, 
location of event, 
entry fee if any and 
prize if any. 

Company also requires that the application should maintain and notify a set of users that are interested in a particular event about any important info like change in details of events or reminders related to that event. 

For each event there should be an independent forum where users can meet and discuss anything. 

Once the event is completed it should be removed from the feed. 

Now this feature should be customizable for every user on the platform on the basis of 
their location (by default upto 10km or if using hierarchical address -> his current city), 
preferred timings (dates), 
preferred budget. (you may add any other suitable parameters).


Design a REST API for the feature that has said requirements and is efficient.
(Assume and mention user model, any other missing information)
(Mention the technologies used)
